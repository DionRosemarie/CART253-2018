        <h1> ABOUT ME </h1>

        <h2> " Our ability to see is also our capacity to understand.With only one look, we can understand and absorb, without realizing it, a lot of informations and this is why I love creating pieces that can talk by  themselves. The designer has the power to communicate without any sentences. We think differently, we go beyond to find an unique solution."  </h2>

        <p> Before coming to Concordia, I did a three-year program in graphic design. I loved to seed every aspect of this art. I discovered myself a passion for typography, packaging, and publicity. Since I was young, I always had a talent in drawing and an eye for powerful visual. I love going outside and look what is surrounding us and ask myself what the creative process behind what is display on the walls or the shelves was. Everybody always referred to me as the artist of the family, but I never knew what I could do with that. My first choice of career was medicine. When I saw that I sucked at maths, I decided to try myself in graphic design. What a right decision I made!  In my last year of CEGEP, I did more interactive and web projects. I loved how things appear on the screen after writing a bunch of incomprehensible texts. I got accepted, and here I am!</p>

        <p>When I’m not procrastinating or doing my project as the last minutes as possible, I enjoy spending times with my closest friends with a cold beer or a huge glass of wine. The simplest thing makes me happy. I laugh easily and make super awkward comments without even knowing it. I don’t mind being behind a screen, but I do need to move a little. I may look small, but I’m a strong girl who enjoys a CrossFit session! </p>
