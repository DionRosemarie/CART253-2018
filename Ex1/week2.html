      <h2> How the atom bomb helped give birth to the Internet <br>by Johnny Ryan </h2>

      <p>Before reading the text on the events of the 1940’s, I thought that everything that happened or surrounded the creation of the atomic bomb was awful. As beautiful the brain and the human intelligence can be, we need to use it in for good things, and war is not one of them. But now that I know the Internet is, kind of, the result of one of the worst human mistake, I’m thankful for that. The birth of this technology gave us some much power and revolutionized the way we had to communicate. At this point, we couldn’t go back. The game was changed forever and probably for the better. The first question that came to my mind while reading was why? Why did we needed to have this idea to create something horrible and to fix the problem we find a solution that wasn't supposed to have this purpose? Why does the human brain works better under pressure and why Baran accepted to participate in this project? Most people will say it’s because of the government, but in every case, we have our words to say. Barand's idea was for the general public, not to launch a nuclear bomb that killed thousands of people. At least, RAND was created and gave us the internet. When the war ended, everybody involves had the chance to develop their project, and the approach was different. When we think about it, wasn’t it a way for the government to keep an eye on new technology and then use it to his advantage? It’s nice to support technological advancements, but you need to have good intentions in my opinion. </p>
