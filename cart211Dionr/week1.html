      <h1> WEEK 1 </h1>
      <h2> As We May Think by Vannevar Bush </h2>

      <p> It’s unbelievable how technology is ubiquitous. It is so important that most people can’t imagine a world without it. Everything we do on a daily basis is ten times easier because someone took the time and the energy to make technology advance and go beyond. As users, typing a word in the research bar of Google is a pretty simple thing to do, but as programmers, it’s not the same thing. To make sure every links and connection that needs to be made are made, we need to develop algorithms and software that will assure the proper operation. After reading this text, my opinion and view on the subject changed radically. It’s so easy to complaint how the internet is slow or blame the program because it’s not working as we would want it to be. The brains behind everything we know can’t predict everything. We should acknowledge more the ingenuity that it takes to make our life easier and how beautiful it is to have the intelligence to create such algorithms. And when we do, we also need to think about the people that came before them. Every technological advancement is due because someone else before couldn’t go beyond his capacity. It’s a pretty incredible teamwork in my opinion. Math is not my cup of tea. I can’t imagine how much time and effort it took to create everything mentioned in this text. I also think it’s sad that sometimes, someone had a specific idea, and maybe the solution to something, and couldn’t realize it because the material or technology wasn’t advanced enough. Providing the resources in this particular branch is a not a loss. We are only investing in our future even though what is going to make is not a daily use objects. Maybe creating something out of the ordinary will resolve other problems we have somewhere else who knows! The brain is magical, and we can’t waste it.</p>
